Mavis
- Mavis is a great team member and her passion to contribute to the project is really something that we as a team member can cherish on
- What I like the most about Mavis is that her ability to explain very well during the Literature Reviews presentation and how she convey the information in a structured manner as well as ensure the project report and presentations are ok.
- Mavis also has good vocabs when delivering the presentation
- What I love to see more in Mavis is that she can try to dive outside from her current project role for example, providing some inputs or feedbacks to the developers and analyst to know what's going on. 
- Would also like to see other hidden potential in Mavis outside her comfort zone e.g. leading a specific project in which this can elevate her confidence level and creative thinking/innovation skills 
All the best Mavis and its nice working to have someone like you in a team. Looking forward to growth and potential in the future :)
