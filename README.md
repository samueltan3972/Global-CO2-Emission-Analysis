### Problem Statement:
1. What is global CO2 emission by country since 1750?
2. What is the expected global CO2 emission by country in 2050? (Regression)
3. Top 10 countries have the highest CO2 emission in volume in 2020
4. Top 10 countries that have the highest CO2 emission per capita in 2020

### Project Objective:
1. To visualize the global CO2 emission by country since 1750 and present in a website using Shinny App
2. To predict the expected global CO2 emission by country in 2050
3. To find out the top 10 countries that have the highest CO2 emission in volume and per capita in 2020

### Project Scope:
1. The project is focus on the global CO2 emission from 1750 to 2020 only

### Findings
1. United States has been the country with the most CO2 emissions country throughout history.
2. China
