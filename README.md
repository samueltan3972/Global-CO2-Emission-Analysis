# Global CO2 Emission Analysis

This is a group assignment for WQD 7001 Principle of Data Science for the Master of Data Science at University of Malaya (UM). This project conduct an anlysis over Global CO2 Emission Analysis. The [report](report/GROUP%20ASSIGNMENT%202%20-%20Group%202.pdf) and [slides](report/GA2_Presentation_Group%202.pdf) of this project can be found at the [report folder](report/). 

The dataset used in this project is obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sasakitetsuya/global-cumulative-co2-emission-gap-analysis/).

## Methodology
#### Problem Statement:
1. What is global CO2 emission by country since 1750?
2. What is the expected global CO2 emission by country in 2050? (Regression)
3. Top 10 countries have the highest CO2 emission in volume in 2020
4. Top 10 countries that have the highest CO2 emission per capita in 2020

#### Project Objective:
1. To visualize the global CO2 emission by country since 1750 and present in a website using Shinny App
2. To predict the expected global CO2 emission by country in 2050
3. To find out the top 10 countries that have the highest CO2 emission in volume and per capita in 2020

#### Project Scope:
1. The project focus on the global CO2 emission from 1750 to 2020 only

#### Findings
1. United States has been the country with the highest cumulative CO2 emissions country throughout history.
2. China has become the highest CO2 emission country in the year of 2020.
3. The forecast cumulative global CO2 emissions by 2050 will reach 2.7 trillion and the global CO2 emission in 2050 will reach 4.45 Giga tonne (Gt).
